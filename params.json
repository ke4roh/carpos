Find songs quickly.\r\n* Need Sonos controller for a cellphone, pda, ...\r\n* Ability to use iTunes Konfabulator widgets with Sonos\r\n* Learn a little about Perl, Javascript & UPnP\r\n* Plugins!\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nA perl script runs and emulates a HTTP server and acts as an UPnP Control Point. The HTTP server portion handles all the requests from the UI, while the UPnP Control Point portion talks to the Sonos boxes. This design was used so Apache or another web server isn't required. UPnP requires that a piece of software is always running to listen for UPnP Events, which is why traditional CGI software can't be used.\r\n\r\nIt assumes all Sonos boxes that respond are on the same Sonos Network, which should be true for most users.\r\n\r\n## Where do I get it?\r\nsonosweb-0.72.tar.gz Windows Installer: sonosweb-0.72.exe\r\n\r\n- [Change History](https://github.com/ke4roh/carpos/blob/master/HISTORY)\r\n- [Previous Versions](http://www.purple.org/sonos/previous.html)\r\n\r\n## Can you make it do this? It doesn't work! Help!\r\nSend mail to sonos@purple.org or post to the Sonos Forums, with questions or suggestions. Please look at the known issues below first.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Same network as Sonos - The sonos.pl script must be run on a machine that is on the same network as the Sonos boxes. For exampe don't run it at work to control home boxes, however the web browser software can be used anywhere.\r\n- Multiple Ethernet Interfaces - Currently doesn't support running on a machine with multiple active interfaces - Fixed in 0.49\r\n- XP Firewall - perl & sonosweb must be added to the allowed firewall applications, usually Windows will prompt to add it automatically.\r\n- Linux Firewall - The following ports must be opened to the local network\r\n-- tcp 8001 - The web browser software uses this port, opening to the internet allows anyone to control too\r\n-- tcp 8058 - UPnP subscription port\r\n-- udp 8008 - UPnP ssdp search port\r\n-- udp 1900 - UPnP ssdp port\r\n\r\n## Will it run on Windows or OS X?\r\nYes. For Windows you can download the installer above, and then you don't need to install Perl seperately.\r\n\r\nHowever for OS X or if you want to do development you will want to install ActiveState Perl. (They even have downloads for UNIX if you don't have perl installed.)\r\n\r\n- Download the sonosweb.tar.gz file above\r\n- Uncompress the sonosweb.tar.gz archive, if using WinZip make sure \"Use folder names\" IS checked\r\n- Goto http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/\r\n- Download ActivePerl 5.8.7.815 or newer (click the \"ActivePerl Free Distribution\" link and follow instructions)\r\n- Install ActivePerl\r\n- After installing ActivePerl, on Windows:\r\n- Open a new shell (Start Menu -> Run -> \"cmd\")\r\n- In the shell run the \"ppm\" command\r\n- At the ppm command prompt type \"install HTML-Template\"\r\n- Once it has finished type \"quit\"\r\n- Change into the sonos directory that was extracted above\r\n- Type \"perl sonos.pl\"\r\n- After installing ActivePerl, on OS X:\r\n-- Open a new terminal window\r\n-- At the prompt run the \"/usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/bin/ppm\" command\r\n-- At the ppm command prompt type \"install HTML-Template\"\r\n-- Once it has finished type \"quit\"\r\n-- Change into the sonos directory that was extracted above\r\n-- Type \"/usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/bin/perl sonos.pl\"\r\n-- Now using a browser on the same machine, goto http://localhost:8001\r\n-- To use from a different machine find the machine's IP address using the ipconfig or ifconfig command, use that ip instead of localhost above\r\n-- All done - Please let me know if this works/doesn't work for you.\r\n\r\n### Other Sonos Projects\r\n[HomeSeer Integration](http://board.homeseer.com/showthread.php?p=700323#post700323)\r\n[Google Discussion Group](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/Sonos)\r\n[Sonos Queue Tool](http://www.ihol.org/sonos/)\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n* Group Volume Control\r\n* Add more features to the Nanny Plugin\r\n* Need Logo & Catchy Name!\r\n* Need better UI and images\r\n* Become a Zone","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
